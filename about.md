    <p>I'm Shantanu, a Computer Science and Statistics student at UC Davis. Through my work in software engineering, quantitative research, and AI safety, I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.<br><br>In my free time I <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/192672997-shantanu-deshpande">love to read</a>, work out, and recently, draw on my iPad. I'm also fascinated by mythology, which led me to pursue a minor in <a href="https://classics.ucdavis.edu/">Classics</a>.</p>
